  I'm a 15 year old guy who is super interested in new technologies and in current times, AI. I love AI for its potential to revolutionize industries, solve complex problems, and enhance creativity in tech and beyond. It is one of the most fun and creative ways to productively pass your free time. This is a portfolio website for me to learn new things related to Javascript, CSS and HTML as well as improve my knowledge related to the upcoming AI software and gain a bit of basic information related to how AI actually works. Hope you learn something new here :)<br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <div class="heading">What Actually Is AI?</div>
  <div class="container1">
  <div class="content">Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is like creating a very smart computer system that can learn, think, and make decisions similar to how humans do. It works by analyzing lots of information to understand patterns, just like how a person learns from experiences. For example, if an AI looks at many pictures of cats, it learns to recognize what makes a cat a cat, so it can correctly identify one when it sees a new picture. AI also uses this knowledge to solve problems, answer questions, or help with tasks like predicting the weather, playing games, or even diagnosing illnesses. The more it practices, the better it gets at these tasks, making it feel like a super-smart assistant that never stops learning and improving. In complex terms,<br> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These systems are capable of learning from large amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and making decisions based on the information they process. For instance, AI can be trained to recognize objects, like identifying a cat in a picture by analyzing thousands of images and learning the distinct features of a cat. Beyond pattern recognition, AI is used to solve complex problems, from predicting weather patterns to aiding in medical diagnostics. It continuously improves by learning from experience, allowing it to become more accurate and efficient over time, effectively functioning as an intelligent assistant capable of performing a wide range of tasks.

   AI is crucial because it improves efficiency and accuracy in many areas. By automating routine tasks, it allows people to focus on more complex and creative work. In healthcare, AI helps diagnose diseases and tailor treatments, while in finance, it detects<br>fraud and optimizes investments. AI also advances transportation with self-driving technology and enhances<br>customer experiences with personalized recommendations.<br></div>

  Chat GPT
  </div>
  <div class="flex">
  <div class="ChatGpt_Content">
    Chat GPT is one of the most versatile and popular LLMs that started the AI Boom. It was launched in November 2022 by OpenAI and has attracted billions of users since its release. It offers a simple UI, insane creativity and is one of the most stable model so far. It has both, a Paid Model(GPT-4) as well as a Free Model(GPT-3.5) and the paid model comes with DALL-E Browsing which enables image generation. You can use it for writing poems for your loved ones, planning events, writing simple codes, getting amazing recipes from dishes all around the world, getting pickup lines and what not!! It is used by hundreds of other AI tools as its base model. Prompt engineering can be used to get amazingly well results like a Professional, Friendly, Casual or a Humourous tone and the introduction of Internet Connectivity has opened its doors to the new information happening all around the world as well. It is available at www.openai.com and get more information about OpenAI here --></div>

  Gemini
  </div>
<div style="display:flex;">
  <p class="ChatGpt_Content">
    Gemini (previously known as Bard) is an LLM introduced by Google developed by their DeepMind Research Faculty. It was launched by March 21, 2023 but didn't get much hype until Feb 2024 when it was re-branded to Gemini and Google made some big promises about their New-Gen AI Model. Like ChatGPT, it comes in two variants, one being paid and the other one being free. It also offers free image generation but as of April 2024 it is not very reliable. It is one of my favourite LLM but it does give incorrect information sometimes so it is not as reliable as ChatGPT but excels at giving factual answers rather than GPT which is known for its creative answers. It has realtime access to Internet even in its free variant which gives it an edge and the best alternative to Chat GPT. Gemini has also been embedded in Gmail, Google Docs and in almost all Google Products to increase ease of access. It is available at gemini.google.com and get more information about Gemini here -->

  Perplexity
  </div>
<div style="display:flex;">
  <p class="ChatGpt_Content">
    Perplexity is a new AI-Powered LLM that's shaking things up. It utilizes natural language processing to understand your search intent and provide comprehensive answers, not just keyword-stuffed links. It prioritizes credible sources with citations and delivers up-to-date information. You can even ask follow-up questions within the same search for a more interactive experience. With a freemium model and mobile app availability, Perplexity offers a promising alternative to traditional search engines and other LLM's like GPT and Gemini. Perplexity AI combines the power of a language model with search functionality to provide real-time, accurate answers by retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple web sources. It uses natural language to directly answer queries, similar to how ChatGPT works, but enhances its responses by providing sources and real-time updates, making it particularly useful for fact-checking and up-to-date information. It's like having a search engine and a conversation with an AI in one.
